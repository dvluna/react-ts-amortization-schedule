# Loan Amortization Schedule

## Overview

This is an extremely simply loan amortization schedule, it is still a work in progress, but should
calculate your payments correctly. If there is some deviation, it would most likely be due to the
roundToHundreth function which rounds to the nearest cent. I feel that reflects real world
calculations a little better, so I am leaving that as is. I may add an option later to toggle the
rounding.
